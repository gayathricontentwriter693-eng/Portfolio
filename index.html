        <p>
            I am a Cloud and AI Technical Writer specializing in DevSecOps, API documentation, and LLM-driven systems.
            I focus on turning complex, highly technical concepts into clear, actionable content that engineers,
            product teams, and customers can quickly understand and trust.
        </p>
        <p>
            My experience spans the full documentation lifecycle&mdash;from content strategy, information architecture,
            and docs-as-code workflows to hands-on authoring, localization, and analytics-driven improvement. I enjoy
            partnering closely with cross-functional teams to build documentation that not only explains how products
            work, but also reduces support load, accelerates onboarding, and supports secure, scalable adoption of
            cloud-native and AI-powered solutions.

    <!-- PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS -->
    <section id="projects" class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Project Highlights</h2>

        <h4>1. Global Cloud Security Platform (2024–2025)</h4>
        <p><strong>Role:</strong> Lead Technical Writer, DevSecOps &amp; Cloud Security</p>
        <p>
            I led documentation efforts for a multi-cloud security platform, focusing on secure CI/CD, compliance, and
            operational excellence. I authored a comprehensive DevSecOps playbook mapping 60+ security controls across
            development, source control, CI/CD, deployment, and organizational practices.
        </p>
        <p>
            I documented automated security scanning, policy-as-code workflows, and infrastructure-as-code patterns in a way
            that was easy for engineering teams to adopt. This work contributed to a measurable reduction in support
            escalations, faster onboarding for new engineers, and a higher deployment success rate for customers.
        </p>

        <h4>2. AI-Driven SaaS Platform (2023–2024)</h4>
        <p>
            I owned the documentation for LLM-powered features and the public API surface of an AI-first SaaS platform.
            This included best-practice guides for prompt engineering, model usage examples, error-handling patterns, and
            reference documentation aligned with OpenAPI specifications.
        </p>
        <p>
            By redesigning the API documentation around real-world use cases, interactive examples, and clear onboarding
            journeys, I helped reduce time-to-first-success for developers and contributed to a significant increase in
            adoption and positive feedback from customers.
        </p>

        <h4>3. Enterprise Data Management Suite (2022–2023)</h4>
        <p>
            I created integration playbooks for data ingestion, transformation, and export APIs, along with SDK
            documentation for Python and Java. My focus was on providing clear end-to-end workflows: from authentication
            and configuration to troubleshooting and performance optimization.
        </p>
        <p>
            I also collaborated on localization workflows for multiple regions, ensuring that documentation stayed aligned
            with compliance requirements and release timelines for international customers.
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Content Strategy, Governance & Localization</h2>
        <p>
            I treat documentation as a strategic product asset, not an afterthought. I focus on creating frameworks and
            workflows that keep content consistent, governed, and easy to maintain as products evolve.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>

    <!-- ROI -->
    <section id="roi" class="section">
        <h2 class="section-title">Impact Metrics & ROI</h2>
        <p>
            I design documentation with measurable outcomes in mind. Wherever possible, I partner with product,
            support, and analytics teams to track the impact of documentation on key metrics.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Reduced support tickets and escalations by making high-value topics easier to find and understand.
            </li>
            <li>
                Shortened onboarding time for engineers, partners, and customers through clear getting-started paths and
                well-documented workflows.
            </li>
            <li>
                Increased adoption of advanced features by providing scenario-based guides, examples, and troubleshooting
                content.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These metrics help demonstrate that documentation is not just a cost center, but a key enabler for product
